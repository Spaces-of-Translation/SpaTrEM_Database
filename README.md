# Future SpaTrEM database

You can find here a sample of the datasets with which we are currently working. For each magazine, we have a table of all the published translations, and another of all the translators who contributed to them (ultimately the plan is to combine those through a translator_ID - EDIT: not anymore, point taken about non-tabular data!). 

NB:
We will have one extra column in the merged spreadsheet: Language_area (German, English, or French).


The "Notes" column has not reached its definitive form yet (as we are still debating whether to include it or not and what to do with it exactly).


The rest has been tidied and is consistent at magazine level but has not yet been checked across magazines - I will be doing this later this week when I merge all the German datasets.
